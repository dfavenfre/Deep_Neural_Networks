# Introduction
Neural networks are a fundamental technology in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. They have revolutionized various domains, from computer vision to natural language processing. However, working with neural networks can be challenging, especially for newcomers. This repository aims to bridge that gap by providing comprehensive, easy-to-follow guides for developing neural networks. Within each folder, you will find a PDF version of guides that are going to be available at my Medium as well.  

# Monthly Updates
I am committed to providing you with up-to-date content. This repository will be regularly updated with new guides and tutorials every month. Stay tuned for the latest advancements in neural network development.
