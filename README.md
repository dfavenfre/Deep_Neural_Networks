# Introduction
Neural networks are a fundamental technology in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, revolutionizing various domains from computer vision to natural language processing. However, working with neural networks can be challenging, especially for newcomers. This repository aims to bridge that gap by offering comprehensive, easy-to-follow guides for developing neural networks. Inside each folder, you will find PDF versions of the guides available on my Medium platform as well. 

# The Roadmap For New Content
In my ongoing commitment to providing comprehensive resources for neural network development, I am excited to announce an upcoming series of guides that will cover a wide spectrum of topics. I will begin by delving into binary and multi-class classification, laying a strong foundation for understanding classification tasks in neural networks. Moving forward, I will explore the fascinating world of image/object detection and classification, where I'll show you how to harness the power of neural networks for tasks like identifying objects within images. Additionally, I will venture into the realm of time-series analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP), leveraging the capabilities of transfer learning with pre-trained models to tackle real-world problems efficiently. Finally, I have ambitious plans to guide you through the development of a Language Model Model (LLM), providing valuable insights into building advanced language models. Stay tuned for these exciting additions to my repository as I continue to empower both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field of neural network development.
