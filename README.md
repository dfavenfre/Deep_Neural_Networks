# Introduction
Neural networks are a fundamental technology in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, revolutionizing various domains from computer vision to natural language processing. However, working with neural networks can be challenging, especially for newcomers. This repository aims to bridge that gap by offering comprehensive, easy-to-follow guides for developing neural networks. Inside each folder, you will find PDF versions of the guides available on my Medium platform as well. 

# The Roadmap For New Content
In my commitment to providing valuable resources for neural network development, I'm pleased to announce an upcoming series of guides. These guides will cover diverse topics, starting with binary and multi-class classification to build a solid foundation in neural network classification. 

Next, we'll explore image/object detection and classification, focusing on practical techniques for identifying objects in images. We'll also delve into time-series analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP), utilizing transfer learning with pre-trained models to solve real-world challenges effectively.

Additionally, I plan to provide insights on developing a Language Model Model (LLM), offering advanced guidance in language model construction. 

Watch for these forthcoming additions to my repository, designed to empower both newcomers and experienced practitioners in the neural network development field.

TL:DR 
  * Binary/Multi-class Classification
  * Image/Object Detection and Classification
  * Time Series Forecasting
  * NLP with pretrained embeddings and transform learning
  * Building an LLM
